## 👀 Interests

I’m interested in all kind of technologies.  
I love playing around with:  
 
 - **PowerShell** - this is what I do most. Check out my [gists](https://gist.github.com/megastary) to see some of my stuff.
 - Linux
 - Windows
 - Android
 - IoT devices (Arduino, Raspberry, other smaller chips)
 - 3D printers
 - .NET core
 - Javascript (and frameworks like Vue, Quasar, Express)
 - Docker
 - CI/CD (Github/Azure DevOps)
 - Unity
 - Games - both playing and making
 - Rust (Very rusty)

## 🌱 Learning

All I do is **learning**. Every single day. I learn by working. I work by learning. I learn by playing. I play by learning.
