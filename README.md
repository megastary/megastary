# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakub

I’m currently the Infrastructure Lead at the largest pool and garden retail company in the Czech Republic.  
Over the years, I advanced from an IT Systems Specialist to leading the infrastructure team, taking on diverse responsibilities motivated by my passion for innovation and experimentation.

I focus on **bridging traditional enterprise environments (VMware, Azure)** with **open-source automation, self-hosting, and IaC**.  
Both at work and at home, I explore FOSS solutions and strive to create sustainable, independent environments.

## 🧠 Professional Focus

- **Infrastructure Management:** Proxmox, VMware vSphere, Hyper-V  
- **Cloud & Services:** Microsoft Azure, Azure DevOps, M365  
- **Automation & IaC:** Ansible, OpenTofu, CI/CD pipelines, Azure DevOps pipeline, Forgejo Actions  
- **Programming & Scripting:** PowerShell, Bash, JavaScript, Typescript  
- **Monitoring & Observability:** OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana  
- **OS & Systems:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), Windows Server
- **✨AI**: All the new shiny things, can't decide which ones are the best and will prevail - Currently fan of n8n

## 🧰 Homelab Overview

My homelab serves as a sandbox for continuous learning and experimentation.  
I use it to test ideas before introducing them in production and to build fully self-hosted services.

- 3-node **Proxmox cluster**
- **TrueNAS Scale** for media and backups
- **Forgejo Git server** with integrated CI/CD using Forgejo Actions  
- Automated deployments via **OpenTofu + Ansible**  
- Self-hosted ecosystem: Vaultwarden, Forgejo, Bookstack, Mailcow, Keycloak, Immich, etc.  
- Continuous experimentation with containerized applications and hybrid integrations

> Goal: build a **resilient, private, and fully automated environment** that mirrors enterprise-grade principles — without dependency on big vendors.

## My Github Organizations

I love exploring collaboration methods so even with one-man projects I create Github orgs to place my projects into.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🧃 Small Business Fridge

The very first big project of mine. Total mess, but biggest software success at our company, everyone loves it!  

- **Stack:** Express.js, MongoDB, Handlebars, Bootstrap  
- **Purpose:** Internal toy-project exploring local app deployment for snacks sharing  
- **Status:** Active in production within our HQ  
- [Main repository](https://github.com/houby-studio/small-business-fridge)  
- [Mobile app repository](https://github.com/aaaorg/sbf-scan)  

### 💤 Lazy Admin

Once very promising project, until I discovered PowerShell Universal, which did it better and this was forgotten in time. Learned a lot about Electron and Quasar.js.

- **Stack:** Quasar.js, Electron, PowerShell  
- **Focus:** UI for predefined scripts allowing less experienced IT admins to easily execute PowerShell functions and scripts  
- [View repository](https://github.com/houby-studio/lazy-admin)

### 🖥️ Dotyker

Very young project, still deciding on the long-term strategy. I am currently building in-house kiosk solution for our retail stores and I want to use what I learn on making somewhat simple and universal kiosk solution for everyone.

- **Stack:** Quasar.js, Ubuntu Core (snap)  
- **Use Case:** Simple, totally free kiosk solution solving the most common use cases for small to medium companies.

## ⚙️ Philosophy

> **Automation first, vendor lock-in last.**  
> I believe in open, modular, and transparent IT environments where infrastructure is reproducible and manageable through code.

## 📈 How I Work

| Area | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🔁 **Continuous Learning** | Regularly testing FOSS tools and integrating them into real workflows |
| 🧩 **Modularity** | Every service is containerized, reproducible, and version-controlled |
| 🔍 **Transparency** | Configuration as code, documentation as Markdown |
| 📦 **CI/CD Everywhere** | Even small experiments get automated build and deploy pipelines |
